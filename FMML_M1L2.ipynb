There are 20640 samples, each with 8 attributes like income of the block, age of the houses per district etc. The task is to predict the cost of the houses per district. We will use the scikit-learn library to load the data and perform some basic data preprocessing and model training. We will also show how to evaluate the model using some common metrics, split the data into training and testing sets, and use cross-validation to get a better estimate of the model's performance."

        "\n",
        "If the training dataset is very small, the model may not be able to learn effectively, even with increased iterations. Each model trained on such a small dataset will be heavily influenced by noise, potentially leading to overfitting.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "In k-fold cross-validation, each data point gets used for training  times and for validation once, meaning every data point contributes to both training and validation. This helps make the most out of the limited data.\n",
